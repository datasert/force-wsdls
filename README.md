# Overview

Salesforce allows to generate only the latest version of the various API wsdls. Sometimes we need to refer to old versions
to compare or analyze etc., and in such cases it has been difficult to get hold of one. This repo is meant to store all versions
of various API wsdls.

Note that we added various versions we had so create a PR if you have old version.
